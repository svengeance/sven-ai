          <p>
            Like many developers before me, I had an idea born because I observed a lack of easy-to-use tooling in some area, and I thought that I could do it better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Husky is the world's first <i>Native</i> C# installer. Normally, C# requires an existing runtime on the user's sytem - in prior versions of Windows, this was even installed as part of the operating system.
            With .NET Core, no such existing runtime exists, and so a .NET Core-based installer would seem impossible, as the 50MB+ runtime (self-contained or not) would preclude that idea.
          </p>
          <p>
            The capability for Husky was inspired by Michal Strehovsk√Ω, who showed that <a href="https://medium.com/@MStrehovsky/building-a-self-contained-game-in-c-under-8-kilobytes-74c3cf60ea04">it is indeed possible to build a C# Snake game in under 8kb</a>.
            Simple? No, but doable. While Husky has no intentions on replacing the core libraries, or foregoing a GC by avoiding heap allocations altogether, Husky sheds the capability of all reflection and dynamic code generation in order to reduce its binary size
            (both of which are critical for most existing high-performance libraries).
          </p>
          <p>
            Husky offers several capabilities not found in any other installer. A web-based (mini-electron) UI, a YAML-first installer workflow configuration, integrated & dockerized E2E testing - these are modern conceps that 
            other installers based on antiquated technologies can not offer as easily as one built on the latest .NET Core SDKs. <br />
            My dream with Husky is to be <i>the</i> open-source installer that developers first think about when contemplating how to deliver their products.

            Sven.ai is fast, fully modern progressive webapp. In my career and personal projects I've previously used Angular for development,
            however this website is my first foray into development with VueJS. I chose it purely out of a closer approximation to Angular, and also because
            I have a personal distaste for Facebook as an organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project features many modern, well-built concepts such as dockerized deployments via CI/CD pipeline, as well as a frontend (Vue) and 
            backend (ASP.Net Core) that are on the latest available versions. Not only that, the server the application is deployed on is a blank-slate
            linux box that I rented and configured for deployment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The layout for SvenAi is inspired by the League of Legends client, and serves as a strong connection between me and my website that
            has me delighted to work on it.

            What started off as series of thoughts akin to <i>"Man, I should really write that down"</i> culminated into this project. Going in, I didn't really understand what one "typically" did for a blog - 
            how were pages managed, how easy was it to write them, where was it deployed, <i>how in the heck did people make blogs so fast?</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            The answer to the above questions was found in the Jamstack technology soup - being able to efficiently write new pages using some CLI-assisted tool, and then publishing the result 
            as a series of statically-generated pages which can be hosted by any provider. My blog itself is hosted via Github Pages - I was surprised, and very pleased, with how fast everything is. 
            Turns out SPAs aren't necessarily the answer for everything these days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blog aside, I did have a little bit of fun trickery while setting up the comment system via Remark42. I wanted an open-source system that had free self-hosting options (honestly - not expecting a whole bunch of comments!), 
            but of course the self-hosting bit means more <i>fun</i> in the setup. Remark42 offered everything I needed, and is hosted via a docker container. It lets users comment from a plethora of accounts - even anonymously 
            (which is cautiously monitored by getting an email per-comment..).

            Often times I come across projects that fulfilled a need while surpassing my expectations, which become staples of my workflow.

            If the project is open source and looks to be well maintained and cared for, I will poke around and see how the codebase is architected, as well as look at the current issues to see what scale of work needs done.
            Being able to experience different styles of code, I feel, is extremely thought-provoking and breaks down preconceived notions of best practices when you can see other architectural styles at play.
