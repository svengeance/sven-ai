Brief introduction, what is this place, and _why Sven?_

<!--more-->

# Hello!

Sven here. Welcome to the first post in my own corner of the internet.

Presently I am a C#-focused developer who dabbles in the other realms as necessary.
Based in Columbus Ohio, I studied at OSU from '13 to '17, and met my S.O. there, who I've been
with a fair number of years.

As a member of a development team I have two objectives that keeps me at the top of my game
  - Be aware of the latest technologies that the world has to offer in the event that I can lead initiatives using these tools to deliver
  better products to our customers, and to make our company more attractive to other developers

  - Balance the timely needs of the business with the desire to produce clean, well-architected code that stands the test of time:
  extensible enough to meet future needs, readable enough to be picked up by anyone, and documented enough to give anyone confidence to hop on and contribute

## Why blog?

My goal with this platform is to document some of the things I do, or have done, in my day-to-day as a developer that may make others' lives easier.
I like to think I'm thorough when approaching development tasks, and this usually allows me to find ~~lazy~~ efficient ways at achieving those tasks.

In my relatively short time as a professional developer, it has been through others' tech blogs such ast his one that I have been able to put together
various pieces of knowledge to make complete products. My hope is that I can _further_ that trend of giving, to write that article that somebody **really** needed
at that point in time.

## Why Sven?

My first job at Select Sires was fresh out of uni in the Summer of 2017. For the in-person interview, I sat down and was introduced to the team.
One of the other devs interviewing me was _also_ named Steve, and I, for reasons I'm unsure of, took this opportunity to avoid conflict and said I go by Sven as a nickname.  

Now this isn't entirely untrue: for my German minor in Uni, I went by Sven for the better part of 4 years in all of my classes. I just didn't expect to carry it with me.

## Why?

Now, _that's_ a question.
